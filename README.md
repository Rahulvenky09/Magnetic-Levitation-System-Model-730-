# Magnetic-Levitation-System-Model-730-
The objective of this project is to design a suitable controller using classical control theory and modern control theory for a magnetic levitation system model 730.
Our aim is to initially linearize the system and then design the PID controllers, state feedback controllers and state observers using classical control
theory and modern control theory respectively.
